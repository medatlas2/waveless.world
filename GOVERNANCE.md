# Governance

We use a **maintainer-led** model with open participation.

- **Decision making:** Discussion in issues/PRs; consensus seeking. If unresolved, core maintainer decides.
- **RFCs:** Substantial changes start with an RFC issue tagged `rfc`.
- **Releases:** Cut by a maintainer after CI passes and changelog is updated.
- **Dispute resolution:** Escalate to security@waveless.world; CoC violations may lead to moderation actions.
