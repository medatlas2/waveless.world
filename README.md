# Waveless World

**Mission:** Protect the privacy of thoughts and signals by detecting, documenting, and disrupting hidden telemetry using open-source tools, RF analyzers, antennas, and AI.

## What this project does
- Scans wide RF/ultrasonic bands and detects anomalies linked to cognitive telemetry
- Issues real-time alerts and logs verifiable evidence for research and legal use
- Supports remote audit stations for planned/spontaneous spectrum checks
- Advances open-source automation for RF telemetry analysis

## Why it matters
The explosion of AI and advanced telemetry increases risks to mental autonomy and signal privacy. Accessible, verifiable tools are urgently needed for protection and accountability.

## Status
Early-stage prototypes using commodity RF analyzers; roadmap targets GHz radar ranges (>20GHz). Seeking contributors and sponsors.
